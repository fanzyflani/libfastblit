I highly recommend that you look at the source code to get a rough idea of how everything works.

You will need to convert a few things to use this library first:

* Palettes need to be converted into an expanded form before use with a lot of functions
* Surfaces need to be expanded before use unless you're willing to stick to 32-bit alignment
